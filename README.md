# Project: Rock Paper Scissors

Console version of Rock Paper Scissors written in JavaScript.

This is my implementation of the ["Project: Rock Paper Scissors"](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors) from The Odin Project.

> NOTE: This version of Rock Paper Scissors is a bare-bones implementation and
> has extremely limited error handling. It will accept all versions of the
> string "rock", "paper", or "scissors" but will call rounds where the user
> enters some other string as a tie.
>
> Furthermore, I have not learned loops yet, so the game logic calls `playRound`
> five times. This will get fixed later when I learn about loops.
