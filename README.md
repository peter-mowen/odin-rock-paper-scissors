# Project: Rock Paper Scissors

This is my implementation of the ["Project: Rock Paper Scissors"](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors) from The Odin Project.

It includes updates from ["Revisiting Rock Paper Scissor"](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-revisiting-rock-paper-scissors)
where a UI is added and the game is played on a webpage using buttons instead of through alert messages.

Go the the
[live preview](https://peter-mowen.github.io/odin-rock-paper-scissors/) to play.
